# Question

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

## Examples

### Example 1
- Input: `ratings = [1,0,2]`
- Output: `5`
- Explanation: You can allocate candies as `[2,1,2]`.

### Example 2
- Input: `ratings = [1,2,2]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: You can allocate candies as `[1,2,1]`. The third child gets `1` candy because it still satisfies the required conditions.

## Constraints

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4`


# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int candies[] = new int[ratings.length];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < ratings.length; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        for (int j = ratings.length - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (ratings[j] > ratings[j + 1]) {
                candies[j] = Math.max(candies[j], candies[j + 1] + 1);
            }
        }
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
            total += candies[i];
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
