# Question

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

 

## Examples

### Example 1
- Input: `gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: Start at station `3` (index `3`) and fill up with `4` units of gas. Tank updates: `0 + 4 = 4`, then after each move it becomes `8`, `7`, `6`, `5`, and finally enough to return to station `3`. Therefore, return `3` as the starting index.

### Example 2
- Input: `gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]`
- Output: `-1`
- Explanation: You cannot start at station `0` or `1` because there is not enough gas to travel to the next station. Starting at station `2` also fails because you cannot return to station `2` at the end. Therefore, you cannot travel around the circuit once from any start.

## Constraints

- `n == gas.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4`
- The input is generated such that the answer is unique.


# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int start = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<gas.length; i++){
            int diff = gas[i]-cost[i];
            sum=sum+diff;
            tank+=diff;
            if(tank<0){
                start = i+1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        return sum>=0?start:-1;
    }
}

```
