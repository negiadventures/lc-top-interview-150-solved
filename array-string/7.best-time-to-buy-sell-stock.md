# Question

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

## Examples

### Example 1
- Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- Output: `5`
- Explanation: Buy on day `2` (price = `1`) and sell on day `5` (price = `6`), profit = `6 - 1 = 5`. Buying on day `2` and selling on day `1` is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2
- Input: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit is `0`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length < 2) return 0;
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i=1; i < prices.length; i++){
            int profit = prices[i] - minPrice;
            maxProfit = Math.max(profit, maxProfit);
            minPrice = Math.min(prices[i], minPrice);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```
